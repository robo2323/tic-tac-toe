## About
- It looks cool, functionality is cool and the AI works well, hard mode you can only draw. The AI is hard-coded though with set rules (best moves in order).
- The code is a nightmare, look at it at your own peril. JS all in one file (I originally wrote it on codepen.io), 800 lines, 500+ lines of less/css. Gross. Enough said.
## TODOs
- [ ] Code badly needs restructuring and refactoring
- [ ] possibly a smarter AI implementation (minmax or using an array lookup?)
