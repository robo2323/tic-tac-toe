## About
- It looks cool, functionality is cool and the AI works well, hard mode you can only draw. The AI is hard-coded though with set rules (best moves in order).
- Uses only vanilla JavaScript and lot's of custom CSS
- The code is a nightmare, look at it at your own peril. JS all in one file (I originally wrote it on codepen.io), 800 lines, I wrote this earlier in my self-learning process so my knowledge of OOP vs functional programming styles and best practices was limited. It's nice to see how I have progressed since then though.
## TODOs
- [ ] Code badly needs restructuring and refactoring
- [ ] possibly a smarter AI implementation (minmax or using an array lookup?)
